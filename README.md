* git clone url -- creates a copy of the remote repo on our local machine

* git add <file> -- git starts tracking a file after we run 'git add', add staging changes to be commited with the next commit

* git commit -m "<message>" -- creates a snapshot of the work in the moment, that we can revisit if necessary.  Creates a trail of work with each change.

* git status -- lists any changes in files that are being tracked, lists any new untracked files, and lists files staged for commit

* git checkout -b <branch-name> -- creates a new branch and switches to that branch
